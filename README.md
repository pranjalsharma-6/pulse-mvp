# Smart Action Extractor (MVP)

A small Next.js + TypeScript prototype that extracts tasks and a concise follow-up message from meeting notes or emails.

This MVP was built as part of the Pulse pre-interview task.  
It demonstrates:
- Fast prototyping
- Feature ownership end-to-end  
- Practical UX thinking
- A simple reasoning layer (mock parser) with optional LLM integration
